## 📖 Overview

This project is a full-stack **Retail Store Inventory and Purchasing API** built to handle high-concurrency workloads (10,000+ simultaneous requests). 

**The Engineering Challenge:** The original monolithic architecture suffered from severe database locking bottlenecks under load. 
**The Solution:** This system was systematically refactored into a clean **MVC architecture**, migrated to **PostgreSQL** with aggressive connection pooling, containerized via **Docker**, and orchestrated across a **Kubernetes** cluster utilizing an **Nginx Ingress Controller** to bypass NodePort networking limits.

This repository serves as a showcase of modern backend engineering, performance tuning, and DevOps best practices.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Traffic is routed through an Nginx Ingress Controller, which bypasses `kube-proxy` for direct upstream load balancing, feeding into a highly available API deployment connected to a persistently provisioned PostgreSQL database.

## ⚡ Performance Engineering & Tuning

This API isn't just containerized; it is mathematically tuned for its execution environment.

### 1. ASGI Worker Optimization
The optimal number of workers prevents excessive CPU context switching while maximizing throughput.
* **Formula:** `Workers = CPU Cores × 0.75`
* **Implementation:** In this K8s deployment, we run **3 Replicas**, each configured with **2 Uvicorn workers** in the `Dockerfile`, yielding an optimal **6 system workers**.

### 2. Database Connection Pooling
To prevent PostgreSQL connection exhaustion under a 10k user load, the connection pool was carefully sized.
* **Formula:** `Max Connections = (Total Workers × 5) + 50`
* **Implementation:** `max_connections` is strictly set to **350** in the Postgres deployment. The SQLAlchemy engine is configured with `pool_size=20` and `max_overflow=30` per worker.

### 3. Nginx Ingress Migration
Standard Kubernetes `NodePort` routes traffic through `iptables`/`kube-proxy`, which capped throughput at ~146 req/sec during load testing. By migrating to an **Nginx Ingress Controller**, we achieved direct upstream routing, recovering the baseline **270+ req/sec** throughput with zero error rates.

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` pipeline automates the entire delivery process on pushes to the `main` or `minikubeMVC` branches using a self-hosted runner:

1. **Unit Testing:** Provisions a Conda environment and executes `pytest` against an isolated, in-memory SQLite database to ensure business logic integrity.
2. **Performance Quality Gate:** Spins up a throwaway Docker container running **Apache JMeter** to execute a stress test against the cluster. A custom Python script (`check_performance.py`) parses the JMeter CSV results and immediately fails the build if error rates exceed thresholds.
3. **Build & Push:** Uses `eval $(minikube docker-env)` to build the optimized Docker image directly into the Minikube daemon, bypassing external container registries for ultra-fast deployments.
4. **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Triggers a `kubectl rollout restart`. The pipeline strictly waits for the new pods to pass their `/health` Readiness and Liveness probes before marking the deployment as successful.

## 💻 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
* Docker Desktop or Minikube
* `kubectl` CLI
* Apache JMeter (for manual load testing)

### 1. Cluster Initialization
```bash
# Start Minikube and enable the required Nginx Ingress addon
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress

# Point Docker CLI to Minikube's internal daemon
eval $(minikube docker-env)  # Linux/macOS
& minikube -p minikube docker-env --shell powershell | Invoke-Expression # Windows
```

### 2. Build & Deploy
```bash
# Build the application image
docker build -t retail-api:latest .

# Deploy the database, API, and Ingress routing
kubectl create namespace retail
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres.yaml -n retail
kubectl apply -f k8s/api.yaml -n retail
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml -n retail
```

### 3. Accessing the Application
Since the Nginx Ingress Controller listens on port 80 and expects the `retail-store.local` host, you must map it:

**On Windows (using Docker driver):**
1. Start the tunnel in a dedicated terminal: `minikube tunnel`
2. Run PowerShell as Administrator and append to your hosts file:
   ```powershell
   Add-Content -Path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" -Value "`n127.0.0.1`tretail-store.local"
   ```

You can now access the application at:
* **Storefront UI:** `http://retail-store.local/`
* **Admin Dashboard UI:** `http://retail-store.local/admin/`
* **Swagger Documentation:** `http://retail-store.local/docs`

## 🧪 Load Testing

A pre-configured JMeter test plan (`batches.jmx`) is included in the root directory. To validate the concurrency optimizations:
1. Open Apache JMeter and load `batches.jmx`.
2. The test is configured to ramp up 10,000 threads (users) making atomic purchases.
3. Review the aggregate graph for 95th percentile response times and error rates under heavy contention.
